              Do you know what you are made of? Are you currently dieting, looking to get in shape, or striving to maximize your performance? Go beyond the scale with our non-invasive body composition scans that provide a detailed breakdown of your weight in terms of muscle, fat, and water. The scans only take anywhere from 15–120 seconds, depending on the model being used.<br/>Body composition analysis is essential to goal setting and vital to completely understanding the relationship between health and weight, as traditional methods can be misleading. Your health is dependent on more than just your weight, therefore, having a clear overview of what you’re made of will help us tailor your diet, exercise and supplement plan to meet your specific goals.<br/> Whether you are looking to shed a few unwanted pounds or experience a complete body transformation, the data provided by our body composition scans is crucial to your health and fitness journey. The easy to understand results sheet contains the amounts and percentages of fat and muscle throughout the body and how your individual body composition compares to a projected healthy range. Don’t worry, a trained Nutrishop team member will review your initial results and all follow-up results with you, offering guidance and support all along the way.<br/>
